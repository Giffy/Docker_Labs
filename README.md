# Docker_Labs
A collection of Scripts for Running Docker Containers and Building Laboratory Architectures

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to facilitate the deployment and management of Docker containers. These scripts can be used to build a laboratory architecture, providing a practical environment for training and understanding software deployment processes.

# Requirements
Requires docker installed:

- Windows: requires WSL 2 and a linux distribution installed recommended Ubuntu 22.04, then follow linux requirements.

- Linux: Installed docker engine, in this repository you can find the official description here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

I included the steps in a bash script (following the official installation). 

- Ubuntu:  the script is named ubuntu_docker_installer.sh
